The model which I have proposed, that is of AI virtual mouse system. 
It can be used to overcome many problems in our real world where as situations where there is no space to apply a physical mouse and also for the people who have problems in their hands and are not able to control a physical mouse.
The proposed model can be used to control the PC mouse functions by using a webcam or a built-in camera.
, the proposed method can be developed to handle the keyboard functionalities along with the mouse functionalities virtually which is another future scope of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).
